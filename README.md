# AI Job Application Agent
## Combine Gemini, Google Docs and Google Sheets to create an agent that can:
- look for suitable jobs in links provided by the user via a CL chat interface.
- Follow up links to jobs of interest to the user and get more info on them.
- Record jobs of interest to the user and their details in a jobs spreadsheet.
- write cover letters for the jobs the user wants to apply for and store them in Google Docs using cover letter templates and user CV.
