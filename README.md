# AI Job Application Agent
## Combine Gemini, Google Docs and Google Sheets APIs to create an AI agent that can:
- Look for suitable jobs in links provided by the user via the CL.
- Follow up links to jobs of interest to the user and get more info on them.
- Write cover letters for the discovered jobs and store them in Google Docs using cover letter templates and user CV (cv.txt file and templates folder with .txt files of cover letter templates not provided in repo).
- Record jobs of interest to the user, their details and a Google Docs link to an AI-generated cover letter in a jobs spreadsheet.
